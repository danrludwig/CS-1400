System Requirements:
    Write a program that imports draws a chessboard. The user will need to input
    where they want the chessboard to start drawing and the height and width of the chessboard.
System Analysis:
    Use assn10.py, add imports and inputs.
    Import chessboard.py that uses turtle to draw a chessboard
System Design:
    Input:
        Starting positions
        Desired width
        Desired height
    Output:
        A program that draws a chessboard with the specs that were inputted from user.
    Calculate:
        How big every small square should be in comparison to the specs of the board. The board is 8 x 8
            small squares.
        Write a program that draws a small black square, and use that many times to create am 8 x 8 white and black
            alternating squares.
Testing:
    Test 1:
        Input 100, 100
            50
            50
        Output NameError: name 'drawChessboard' is not defined
        Needs to import chessboard.py
    Test 2:
        Input: 0,0
            Null
            Null
        Output a chessboard with desired specs
        Is perfect
