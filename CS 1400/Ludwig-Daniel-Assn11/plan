System Requirements:
    Write a program that gives the user to draw a circle out of either circles or squares.
    The user can set the variables of the circle.
    The user also has a super pattern option that has the computer choose all the variables and
        shapes for them. The user just chooses how many to have the computer draw.
System Analysis:
    Use assn11.py to run main and get inputs for the patterns to be draw.
    Import pattern.py that uses turtle to draw the patterns chosen by the user.
System Design:
    Input:
        Which shape to use to draw.
        What variables to use for the stats of the circle.
        Does the user want to go again? If so do they want to clear the board?
    Output:
        A circle drawn out of either rectangles or circles. If user chooses super pattern
            then there can be multiple drawn.
    Calculate:
        Use random() to randomize variables for super pattern.
        Where to draw, how big to draw, and what shapes to use.
Testing:
    Test 1:
        Input: 1
        0,0
        25
        40
        5
        100
        4
        3
        Output: correctly drawn circle using rectangles.
    Test 2:
        Input: 3
        5
        3
        Output: 5 randomly drawn circles. 4 Using circles, 1 using rectangle.
