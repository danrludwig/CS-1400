Task 2

System Requirements:
    Create a system where the user inputs a password and it gets checked if its valid or not.
    Password requirements:
        The password must have at least eight characters.
        The password must consist of only letters and digits.
        The password must contain at least two digits.
        The password cannot contain the word 'password'
        The password cannot end with '123'
System Analysis:
    Use assn13-task2.py to use the class Password and receive input from the user, also outputs anything.
    The class Password is what's going to be used in checking the password to see if it meets all the
        requirements.
System Design:
    Input: the password from the user
    Calculate: Whether the password meets the requirements
    Output: If the password meets the requirement then an approval will be outputted, otherwise the program
        will notify the user the password isn't good enough and why the password wasn't accepted.
Testing:
    Test 1:
        Input: whatever
        Ourput: Invalid Password
                Errors:

                [2, 3]
        Need to find out why __errors aren't going into __message.
        Didn't call __isValid function, decided to add it.
    Test 2:
        Input: thisisthecode12
        Output: Valid Password
                Enter "y" to enter another password:
        Is perfect.
