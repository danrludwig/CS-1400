Task 1

System Requirements:
    Write a program that imports draws a chessboard. The user will need to input
    where they want the chessboard to start drawing and the height and width of the chessboard.
System Analysis:
    Use assn13-task1.py, add imports from turtle and Chessboard class and inputs.
    Import chessboard.py that uses turtle to draw a chessboard. Define Chessboard as a class and import it to
        assn13-task1.py
System Design:
    Input:
        Starting positions
        Desired width
        Desired height
    Output:
        A program that draws a chessboard with the specs that were inputted from user.
    Calculate:
        How big every small square should be in comparison to the specs of the board. The board is 8 x 8
            small squares.
        Write a program that draws a small black square, and use that many times to create am 8 x 8 white and black
            alternating squares.
Testing:
    Test 1:
        Input 100, 100
            50
            50
        Output Runtime Error
        Review errors on chessboard.py and fix them, has to do with self.__***
    Test 2:
        Input: 0,0
            150
            100
        Output a chessboard with desired specs
        Is perfect
